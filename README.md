# Angular Tarot Reading

A simple MEAN stack application that allows users to shuffle and select tarot cards and then see their fortunes. (Not to be taken as actual fortune telling.)

## Getting started
Here are the steps to running the application locally.

Start the server:
1. Open a terminal in the root directory.
2. Move to the server directory ( `cd server` ) and run `npm i` to install server dependencies.
3. Run `node index.js` to start the server. If you have nodemon install globally, you can run `nodemon`.

Start the client:
1. Open another terminal in the root directory.
2. Move to the client directory ( `cd client` ) and run `npm i` to install client dependencies.
3. Run `ng serve --open` to start the application and open it in your browser.
